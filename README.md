Smores
================

----------------------
_Short for **S**o **M**any **ORES**!_

-------------------

Ever get tired of how many goddamn ores every mod adds? Like Substratum, but can't stand the forge log spam, or those unsightly slabs and stairs? Wish there was a distilled, short and to the point mod that accomplished the same thing?

## Welcome To Smores
Smores does something super, super simple - it just adds all of those ores, ingots, gems, etc. you might want, and registers them with the OreDictionary.

### Players
Your favourite modpacks can have condensed ores, without the hacky nature of other ore-silencing mods.

### Modders
Don't worry about generating ores, gears, plates, dusts, gems, or anything like that! We give you a solid base on which to construct your next general material-utilizing mod.

### Modpackers
A one stop solution for ores and other materials! Allows for simple configuration of ore generation/manipulation, without searching out configs for 100 seperate mods that all implement copper.

## FAQ
### Q. Ooh! What about (random ore/metal)?
It's entirely possibly we're either thinking about adding it! Create an issue if it's something you can't live without (or can justify a wide swathe of uses for).

### Q. This seems like a Substratum ripoff.
We're trying to make the "perfect" substratum for *us* - one that doesn't do all of the things we don't like, like add blocks we don't want and Thermal Expansion/Foundation/Dynamics ores that only apply to that ecosystem. 

### Q. Why should I use this if my favourite mod already adds ores?
Don't! This is primarily to establish a precedent of mods that offload the task of ore/metals/materials generation onto other, more flexible mods, and reduce the cruft of duplicated ores. If your favourite mod already generates ores, then this mod only adds noise.
